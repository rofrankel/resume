  "readme": "# JSON-Resume-Paper\n\nThis is a theme for [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/).\nIt is available via npm:\n\n```\nnpm install jsonresume-theme-paper\n```\n\n## PDF / Printing\n\nSince the printing functionality of `resume-cli` is a utter catastrophy where your `.html` file gets\nposted to a webservice for converted to `.pdf` this theme will not support this process.\n\n**BUT**\n\nI've implemented another `.css` file that gets included with a attribute `print`: `media=\"print\"`.\n\nSo if you're trying to convert your resume from `.html` to `.pdf` just use Google Chrome and \nthen PDF Print!\n\nIn my opinion this does the best job in formating and layouting.\n\n\n## Demo\nYou can check out a static demo of the resume on codepen.io: http://codepen.io/TimDaub/pen/bfCLz\n\n\nThe folks over at jsonschema.org did an awesome job promoting my theme, so you can check it out here as well: http://themes.jsonresume.org/theme/paper\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started with theme development, this is what you'll need:\n\n- [node.js](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs)\n- [npm](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm)\n\nIf you're on Linux, you can simply run:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm\n```\n\nOr if you're on OSX and got [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed:\n```\nbrew install node\n```\n\n### Install the command line\n\nWe're going to use the official [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) to run our development server.\n\nGo ahead and install it:\n\n```\nsudo npm install -g resume-cli\n```\n\n### Install npm packages\n\nWe need to install the dependencies. `cd` into the theme folder we just downloaded and run:\n\n```bash\nsudo npm install\nbower install\n```\n\nThis will read the local `package.json` and install the packages listed under `dependencies`.\n\n### Serve theme\n\nWhile inside the theme folder, simply run:\n\n```\nresume serve\n```\n\nYou should now see this message:\n\n```\nPreview: http://localhost:4000\nPress ctrl-c to stop\n```\n\nCongratulations, you've made it!\n\n__The theme development can now begin.__\n\n\n## License\n\nAvailable under [the MIT license](http://mths.be/mit).\n",
